[b]Powerful Modding Library for Klei's [i]Oxygen Not Included[/i][/b]

[h1]Features[/h1]
PipLib, on its own, does not do much to change up the game (there are some though, see below), but it provides a powerful
foundation for mods to add new and exciting things to Oxygen Not Included.
[list]
[*][b]Streamlined Mod Loading[/b]
  [list]
  [*] Have your mod loaded by the library, not the other way around
  [*] Simply mod class to implement rather than having to register your mod with anything
  [/list]
[*][b]Custom Elements[/b]
  [list]
  [*] Create new elements and substances within the game with ease
  [/list]
[*][b]Overhauled Research Tree[/b]
  [list]
  [*] New dynamic research tree that is built on-the-fly instead of hard-coded in the assets
  [*] Ability to add new custom techs for your new stuff!
  [/list]
[/list]


[h1]Changes to the Game[/h1]
PipLib does make some minor changes to the game to facilitate new things.
[list]
[*] [b]The vanilla research tree has been reorganized:[/b] This is a result of the tree now being dynamic
[*] [b]Element files are `.yml` not `.yaml`:[/b] To avoid a bug with the vanilla YAML loader, a different extension is used
[/list]


[h1]Usage[/h1]
To learn how to create mods using PipLib, take a look at the examples located in [url=https://lab.vevox.io/games/oxygen-not-included/piplib/tree/master/ExampleMod]ExampleMod[/url], namely [b]ExampleMod.cs[/b] and [b]Examplemod.csproj[/b].

[b]Do not[/b] pack PipLib with your mod: this [i]will[/i] break things!. Instead, upload your mod by itself to the workshop, then use the [b]Add/Remove Required Items[/b] option when editing the item.
